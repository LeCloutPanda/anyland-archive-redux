{"v":9,"a":[22,18],"p":[{"b":18,"e":"WELCOME TO DAVID BOREANA... I MEAN, BOJACK'S HOUSE. THIS WORLD IS A WORK\nIN PROGRESS, BUT IS MEANT TO BE A RECREATION OF BOJACK HORSEMAN'S HOUSE\nFROM THE ACCLAIMED NETFLIX ORIGINAL \"BOJACK HORSEMAN\". IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN\nIT (AND EVEN IF YOU HAVE), I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT! ULTIMATELY I PLAN TO BUILD \nEVERY ASPECT OF HIS HOUSE, INCLUDING SOME OF THE SURROUNDING SCENERY.\nFOR NOW, MY PRIMARY FOCUS IS TO GET THE MAIN ASPECTS OF HIS HOUSE INTO THE\nBUILD. I ALSO PLAN TO LATER ADD MORE INTERACTABLE FEATURES LIKE WORKING\nLIGHTS, DOORS, FOOD/DRINK, ETC.\n\nSOMETHING TO NOTE:THERE ARE ACTUALLY MANY INCONSISTENCIES IN BOJACK'S HOUSE\nDURING THE SHOW. FOR EXAMPLE, SOME AREAS OF HIS HOUSE ARE NEVER SHOWN ON SCREEN,\nAND SOME ASPECTS OF HIS HOUSE APPEAR DIFFERENTLY IN DIFFERENT SHOTS. I'LL HAVE TO\nTAKE SOME CREATIVE LIBERTY AND BRIDGE THE GAP IN THESE AREAS.\n\nI PLAN TO UPDATE THIS BUILD FREQUENTLY UNTIL I REACH MY ULTIMATE GOAL. FEEL FREE TO\nLOOK AROUND, AND THANKS FOR STOPPING BY!\n","s":[{"p":[0,0,0],"r":[0,0,0],"s":[0.003001512,0.003004133,0.003002215],"c":[0.111111,0.1619042,1]}]}]}
